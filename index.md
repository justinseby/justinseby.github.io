# About Me

<img src="images/Profile Picture.jpeg" class="floatpic">

I am **Justin Seby**, and I am a PhD student at the Karolinska Institute, one of the world's leading medical universities, specializing in AI applications in cancer medicine. I am currently working under the supervision of [Prof. Janne Lehtiö](https://ki.se/en/onkpat/janne-lehtio-group) at the Lehtiö Lab in the Department of Oncology-Pathology. I completed my Master's in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in AI from the University of Oulu, Finland, where I was honored to receive the University of Oulu Scholarship for academic excellence. Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience in AI-driven projects spanning cybersecurity, physics, and now Cancer medicine. <br>

If you are interested in any aspect of my research or would like to discuss potential collaborations, I am always open to meaningful discussions. Feel free to reach out to me at - [justin.seby] [at] ki.se

Welcome to my thoughts on AI, mental health, academia, and personal experiences. Here you'll find reflections on technology's role in our lives and my journey through graduate studies.

## AI and Mental Health: Can Artificial Intelligence Be the Future of Therapy?

**May 13, 2024**

Okay, Picture this: It’s 2 AM, and you’ve convinced yourself that missing that last deadline means you’ll never amount to anything (which, let’s be honest, happens more often than I’d like to admit) or you’re deep in a LinkedIn doom-scroll spiral, watching strangers announce promotions while you contemplate quitting your job and becoming a goat farmer in the Alps (again, not my worst idea). Or you Googled one mild headache, and now you’re 90% sure you have a rare disease (do I even need to say it? Yes, I do this too).

## So Apparently I'm a Writer Now?

**May 12, 2024**

I didn’t think I’d start writing here. But here we are. I moved to Finland for my master’s because I hated the heat. Then, I moved to Sweden for my PhD because I hate peace and quiet. So… Currently doing a PhD in AI for cancer medicine at Karolinska Institutet — which, by the way, is one of the top 10 universities in the world. (I had to mention that. humble flex, let me have this) I spend most of my time figuring out how both cancer cells and neural networks behave.
